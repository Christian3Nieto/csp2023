            <p class="reason"><i>Computer science has been an enjoyable course and new experience for me. I've always been interested in learning the basics of coding, but was intimidated by the source coding because it looked too complex and overwhelming. However, recently my interests and hobbies have been both mechanical and technology related. For this reason, I took the opportunity to try out computer science when it was offered to me. This year I have had fun learning and using basic coding to create simple web pages. Also, I realized that this course is not as difficult as it looks, which has motivated me to want to continue learning more about computer science.</i></p>

            <p class="more"><i>In elementary school, I was part of a STEM summer club where we learned the basics of the four branches of engineering. These branches were science, technology, engineering, and math. The goal was to use our new knowledge to build a functional solar-powered lego cart. If we were able to accomplish the task, then we would “graduate” and receive a certificate for our small invention.</i></p>
            <p class="more"><i>As I mentioned before, I have recently been interested in mechanical and technology related things, but mostly assembling these components. The first time I had hands-on experience was when I built my first computer, so it was extremely satisfying when I had finished putting my setup together.</i></p>
